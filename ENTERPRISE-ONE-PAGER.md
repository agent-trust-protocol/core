## 🚨 The Problem: Your AI Agents Are Quantum-Vulnerable

**Current AI agent security will be obsolete within 10-15 years** when quantum computers break RSA-2048 and current encryption standards. Enterprise AI deployments using Model Context Protocol (MCP) have **zero quantum-safe protection**.

### The Cost of Inaction
- **$4.45M** average cost per data breach
- **Up to 4% of global revenue** in regulatory fines
- **Complete system obsolescence** when quantum computers arrive
- **Irreversible reputation damage** from security failures
