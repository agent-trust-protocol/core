# 🚀 START HERE: Option A Implementation

## Quick Start Commands

Run these commands in order and share any errors you see:

### **1. Build SDK Package**
```bash
cd /Users/jacklu/agent-trust-protocol-1/packages/sdk
npm install
npm run build
```

**Share the output** - especially any errors!

---

### **2. Build Shared Package**
```bash
cd /Users/jacklu/agent-trust-protocol-1/packages/shared
npm install
npm run build
```

**Share the output** - especially any errors!

---

### **3. Check if dist folders were created**
```bash
ls -la /Users/jacklu/agent-trust-protocol-1/packages/sdk/dist
ls -la /Users/jacklu/agent-trust-protocol-1/packages/shared/dist
```

## What I've Set Up For You

✅ **Clean Dockerfile created**: `website-repo/Dockerfile.production.clean`
- Uses pre-built packages instead of building in Docker
- Much faster and cleaner

✅ **Docker Compose updated**: Now uses the clean Dockerfile

✅ **Step-by-step guide**: `OPTION_A_STEP_BY_STEP.md` has detailed instructions

## Next Steps

1. **Run the commands above** and share any errors
2. **I'll help fix errors** as they appear
3. **Once both packages build**, Docker will use the pre-built versions
4. **Then we move to Option B** - fixing remaining issues properly
