## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


Trust Protocol Security Framework

Core Business Logic Components:

1. Advanced Rate Limiting System
Importance Score: 85
Implements multi-strategy rate limiting with distributed Redis support, progressive delay with exponential backoff, and specialized limiters for different security contexts.

2. Blockchain Audit System 
Importance Score: 90
Provides immutable audit trail using blockchain principles, Merkle tree implementation for verification, and transaction anchoring with validator consensus.

3. Policy Evaluation Engine
Importance Score: 95
Complex trust policy evaluation system incorporating agent trust levels, verifiable credentials, context-aware conditions and custom obligation handling logic.

4. Zero Knowledge Proof System
Importance Score: 88
Selective disclosure proof system with range proofs, membership verification via Merkle trees, and Pedersen commitment scheme implementation.

5. RBAC System
Importance Score: 85
Organization-scoped permission system with hierarchical role inheritance, fine-grained ACL with conditional permissions, and multi-tenant role management.

Critical Integration Points:

1. Trust Level Management
- Progressive trust levels from basic to enterprise
- Capability-based access tied to trust scores
- Real-time trust evaluation based on agent behavior

2. Policy Enforcement
- Multi-factor policy decisions 
- Context-aware evaluation
- Credential verification workflows

3. Audit System
- Blockchain-anchored immutable logs
- Cryptographic proof generation
- Trust-based validation requirements

The framework implements a sophisticated security model centered around trust levels, policy enforcement, and verifiable audit trails. Core innovation lies in the integration of blockchain principles, zero-knowledge proofs, and progressive trust scoring.
