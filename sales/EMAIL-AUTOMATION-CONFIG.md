# 🛡️ Agent Trust Protocol™ - Email Automation Configuration

## HubSpot Email Sequence Setup Guide

This document provides the complete configuration for ATP's automated email sequences targeting Fortune 500 prospects for quantum-safe AI agent security pilot programs.

## 📧 Sequence 1: C-Suite Executive Outreach

### **Sequence Configuration**
- **Target Audience**: CEOs, CTOs, CISOs of Fortune 500 companies
- **Duration**: 4 weeks (5 emails)
- **Send Schedule**: Business days, 9 AM recipient timezone
- **Personalization**: Company name, industry, AI initiatives, quantum threat level

### **Email 1: Quantum Threat Urgency (Day 1)**

**Subject Line A/B Test**:
- Version A: "{{company.name}}'s AI agents are vulnerable to quantum attacks"
- Version B: "Quantum threat timeline accelerated - {{company.name}} impact assessment"

**Email Template**:

Hi {{contact.firstname}},

The quantum threat to AI security just accelerated dramatically.

IBM's latest quantum processors have crossed the 1,000+ qubit threshold, and Google's breakthrough in quantum error correction means cryptographically relevant attacks are now expected by 2026 - not 2030 as previously thought.

This puts {{company.name}}'s AI agents at immediate risk:
• {{company.ai_initiative}} vulnerable to quantum decryption
• Customer data exposed through compromised AI communications  
• Proprietary AI models at risk of intellectual property theft

As {{contact.jobtitle}} at {{company.name}}, you're likely already thinking about this threat. The question is: what's your quantum-safe strategy?

Agent Trust Protocol™ is the world's first quantum-safe AI agent security protocol. We've already helped Fortune 500 companies in {{company.industry}} protect their AI investments.

Would you be open to a 15-minute quantum threat briefing specific to {{company.name}}'s AI initiatives?

Best regards,
[Sales Rep Name]
Senior Enterprise Consultant
Agent Trust Protocol™

P.S. We're offering exclusive Q4 pilot programs to the first 5 companies in {{company.industry}}. {{company.name}} would be first in your sector.
