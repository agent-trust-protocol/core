   - [ ] Create industry pilot programs

#### Success Metrics:
- Positive CG vote on ATP integration
- 3+ major companies expressing interest
- Technical specification officially adopted

### Phase 4: Specification Enhancement (Month 3-4)
#### Actions:
1. **Enhance ANP Specification**
   - [ ] Formally integrate ATP into ANP security module
   - [ ] Add quantum-safe requirements to ANP
   - [ ] Create interoperability guidelines

2. **Joint Publications**
   - [ ] Co-author enhanced CG white paper
   - [ ] Publish joint blog posts/articles
   - [ ] Present at industry conferences

3. **Implementation Support**
   - [ ] Help other implementers integrate ATP
   - [ ] Provide reference code and SDKs
   - [ ] Create developer documentation

#### Deliverables:
- Enhanced ANP specification with ATP
- Joint white paper
- Multi-vendor implementations

## Key Messages for Different Audiences

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Challenges & Solutions

1. **"Not Invented Here" Syndrome**
   - **Risk**: CG prefers to build their own security
   - **Mitigation**: Position as contribution, not replacement
   - **Message**: "We're here to help, not take over"

2. **Technical Complexity Concerns**
   - **Risk**: Quantum-safe crypto seen as too complex
   - **Mitigation**: Emphasize simple 3-line developer API
   - **Message**: "Complex crypto, simple interface"

3. **Competing Priorities**
   - **Risk**: CG focused on other protocol aspects
   - **Mitigation**: Show how security enables everything else
   - **Message**: "Security is the foundation, not an afterthought"

4. **Standardization Timeline**
   - **Risk**: W3C process seen as too slow
   - **Mitigation**: Offer working implementation today
   - **Message**: "Use now, standardize later"
