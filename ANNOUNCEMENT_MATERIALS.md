## 📝 Reddit Post (r/node, r/javascript, r/programming)

**Title:** [Announcement] ATP SDK v1.1.0 - First SDK with Quantum-Safe Cryptography by Default

**Body:**

We just released ATP SDK v1.1.0, making it the first SDK to enable quantum-safe cryptography by default for AI agents.

**What's Quantum-Safe?**
Quantum computers will break current encryption (RSA, ECC) within 10-15 years. Quantum-safe cryptography uses algorithms that remain secure even against quantum attacks.

**Why This Matters:**
If you're building AI agents that need to remain secure long-term, quantum-safe cryptography is essential. ATP SDK makes it easy - zero configuration required.

**Quick Start:**
```bash
npm install atp-sdk
```

```typescript
import { Agent } from 'atp-sdk';
const agent = await Agent.create('MyBot');
console.log(agent.isQuantumSafe()); // true
```

**Key Features:**
• Hybrid ML-DSA + Ed25519 (NIST-standardized)
• Zero configuration - works immediately
• Fully backward compatible
• Open source (Apache 2.0)
